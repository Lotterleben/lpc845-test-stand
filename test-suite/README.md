# test-suite

The test suite that is run on the host PC. Besides the tests itself, this crate contains some infrastructure to support those tests. That infrastructure code is specific to this test suite. It can be used as a model for similar crates in other test suites, but is unlikely to be applicable directly.

See [top-level README](https://github.com/braun-embedded/lpc845-test-stand/blob/master/README.md) for more information.
