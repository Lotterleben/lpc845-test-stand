# protocol

Generic (i.e. independent of any specific test stand) building blocks that can be used to build a test-stand specific protocol. This crate is a dependency of the `messages` crate in this same repository.

See [top-level README](https://github.com/braun-embedded/lpc845-test-stand/blob/master/README.md) for more information.
