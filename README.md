# LPC845 Test Stand

## Introduction

A test stand for firmware applications. Allows you to control an application under test while it is running on the hardware, and verify that it behaves correctly.

The long-term vision is to turn this into a generally applicable product. For now, it only supports NXP LPC845 microcontrollers.

## Status

As of this writing, nothing but this README and a few ideas exist. Please check out the list of merged pull requests to see if any more progress has been made since then.
